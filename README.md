## Cancer patients, especially those from underprivileged and uneducated backgrounds, face significant challenges in accessing proper treatment. These include long hospital wait times, difficulty understanding medical procedures, emotional distress, and financial burdens. Many patients experience treatment delays due to barriers such as transportation issues, language difficulties, and lack of guidance throughout their care journey.

While doctors provide essential care, there is a critical gap in structured support from patient navigators—nurses, social workers, and cancer survivors—who can assist patients in managing appointments, understanding treatment plans, and receiving emotional and logistical support. Additionally, many patients remain unaware of financial aid programs that could ease their burden.

A major challenge is the unstructured nature of medical records, making it difficult for patients and caregivers to retrieve relevant medical history quickly. Organizing and indexing these records using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve access to personalized care recommendations, streamline diagnosis support, and enhance treatment efficiency.

To address these challenges, we need an accessible digital platform that:
✔ Connects patients with verified doctors for treatment
✔ Links them to certified patient navigators for continuous support
✔ Provides financial navigation to reduce healthcare costs
✔ Implements AI-driven report indexing using RAG for structured and easy retrieval of medical records

By bridging the gap between patients, caregivers, and support systems while improving access to medical information, this solution will reduce treatment delays, enhance emotional well-being, and make cancer care more inclusive, efficient, and affordable, creating a lasting socio-economic impact.
